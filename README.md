# Rust Diesel Schema Parser
A tool to parse your Schema files generated by Diesel and Generate Models for you to use.

To run, you need a list of things:
- Install Diesel
- Connect it to a database
- Run both setup and migrate to generate the `schema.rs` file
- A template (see examples)
- A config in the root of your project with the name `.db-schema-parser-config.json` (see examples)
- A folder to for your models to be generated in

With all of these things in place, all you have to do is configure and then run the binary!
